Role: Expert Frontend & Security Engineer
Context: Neural Sentinel SOC Console (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, Gemini AI)

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Maintain stability, correctness, and operator clarity in a Cyber-Tactical Dashboard managing Local (Windows) and Remote (Linux/Pi) telemetry.

---

1. ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS
- Data Source: LOCAL (127.0.0.1/Windows) vs REMOTE (User IP/Linux).
- AI Tiers: "Core Probes" (4k-8k tokens) vs "Neural Probes" (400-800 tokens).
- Persistence: 24h CSV history sliding window. LocalManifest merging on restart.

2. TIERED SLOT RULES
- LOW (Teal): Global management only. No per-panel configuration rendering. Displays status visually but interaction is disabled at panel level.
- MEDIUM/PROBE (Purple): Per-panel configuration. Core Data Probes.
- HIGH/SENSOR (Orange): Specific panels (Scanner). 1-hour persistent cooldown.
- MASTER CORE PROBE:
  - Unique to MASTER_INTELLIGENCE panel.
  - Aggregation Logic: Iterate through `settings.panelSlots`. If a panel has an active `probeSlot.launcherId`, call its `PROBE_CONTRACTS[pid].buildPayload` and push to an aggregation array.
  - Limits: Single 4000-token aggregated payload. 
  - Cooldown: 5-minute global interval (300,000ms).

3. SCRIPT & CONSUMABLE LOGIC
- System Scripts: Reset results and trigger full radar scans.
- Buffer Scripts: Enhance state without clearing existing radar data.
- Boosters: Consumables (e.g., Bypasser) used in 'main' slot types. Fire immediately upon selection in InventoryDialog.
- Reload Timers: Reduce sensor module cooldowns (e.g., from 1hr to 1min).

4. VISUAL & UI STANDARDS
- HUD Elements: CRT Flicker, Scanlines, Chromatic Aberration.
- Color Coding: 
  - BLUE (#00f2ff): Local/Sim
  - GREEN (#22c55e): Remote/Success
  - RED (#ff3e3e): Offline/Error
  - PURPLE (#bd00ff): Neural/Probe
  - TEAL (#00ffd5): Neural/Low (Global)
  - ORANGE (#f97316): Hardware/Sensor
- Config Commit: MANDATORY "CONFIRM" button in InventoryDialog for hardware changes.

5. RESTRICTIONS
- Do not modify existing probe contracts.
- Do not introduce external state libraries.
- Do not restore per-panel low slot configuration.
- Do not change 5050 backend telemetry schemas.
