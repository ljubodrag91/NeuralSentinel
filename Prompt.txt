Role: Expert Frontend & Security Engineer
Context: Neural Sentinel SOC Console (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, Gemini AI)

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Maintain stability, correctness, and operator clarity in a high-fidelity Cyber-Tactical Dashboard. 
The application manages both Local (Windows) and Remote (Linux/Pi) telemetry sources using a Tiered Slot Architecture.

---

1. ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS (DO NOT BREAK)
- State Management: React useState/useEffect. Persistent state via `HistoryStorage` and `LauncherSystem` in localStorage.
- Data Source Routing: 
  - LOCAL mode = 127.0.0.1 (Windows HUD).
  - REMOTE mode = User-defined IP (Linux HUD).
- AI Integration: 
  - Gemini (Cloud) and Local LLM support.
  - "Core Probes" = Heavy analysis (Tokens: 4000-8000).
  - "Neural Probes" = Lightweight inference (Tokens: 400-800).
- Data Persistence: 24-hour sliding window for CSV history logs.

2. TIERED SLOT LOGIC
- LOW (Teal): Neural/Inference only.
- MEDIUM (Purple): Core Data Probes.
- HIGH (Orange): Specialized Hardware (Sensors) & Scripts.
  - High slot cooldown: 1 hour base. Persisted.
  - Buffer Scripts (e.g., Script Reload Timer) can reduce cooldowns (e.g., from 1 hour to 1 minute).
- Charges: Low/Medium reflect the minimum charges among all active modules of that tier. High slot is limited to 1.

3. PROBE CONTRACT EXAMPLES
- GLOBAL_SYSTEM_PROBE:
  - Description: Consolidated system-wide security audit.
  - Expected Response: JSON Assessment (threat_level, anomalies, recommendations).
  - compatibleSlots: Medium, High.
- NEURO_DATA_PROBE:
  - Description: Contextual metadata inference for UI labels.
  - Expected Response: JSON mapping labels to security descriptions.
  - compatibleSlots: Low.

4. VISUAL & UI RULES
- Aesthetics: Cyber-Tactical HUD (Scanlines, CRT flicker).
- Color Coding (Strict):
  - BLUE/CYAN (#00f2ff) -> Local Host / Simulation
  - GREEN (#22c55e) -> Remote Host / Success
  - RED (#ff3e3e) -> Offline / Error
  - PURPLE (#bd00ff) -> Neural Activity (Medium)
  - TEAL (#00ffd5) -> Neural Activity (Low)
  - ORANGE (#f97316) -> Hardware/Scripts (High)
- Confirm Buttons: MANDATORY in all MATRIX_CONFIG dialogs for committing hardware changes.

5. SCANNER FUNCTIONALITY
- Node Grid: Radial scanning animation.
- Quick Fire: Circle icon in header fires data-type sensors immediately and switches tab to "Scanner".
- Sensor Cooldown: 1 minute (if optimized), 1 hour (base).

6. DYNAMIC REFLECTION
- Any item, module, or launcher added via Admin or modified in the manifest MUST be merged with base data on app restart to ensure persistence.

7. NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS
- Do not introduce external state libraries.
- Do not remove the "FROG_ASCII" easter egg.
- Do not change JSON schemas expected by the 5050 backend.
- Do not rename "Neural Probe" or "Core Probe".
