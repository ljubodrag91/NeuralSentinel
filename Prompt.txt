Project Name: Neural W Monitor - Kali Linux Interface for Penetration Testing

Project Overview:
Create a multi-window, high-fidelity security dashboard designed for remote management of Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi devices. The UI must follow a "Cyber-Tactical HUD" aesthetic with scanlines, CRT flicker, and chromatic aberration effects.

Core Requirements:
1. Multi-Tab Interface:
   - Dashboard (Link status, Handshake config, Network adapters)
   - Telemetry (Live AreaCharts for RF Signal and Spectral Density)
   - Pi Stats (CPU, RAM, Disk, Thermal monitoring, Process list)
   - Toolkit (Categorized tool selection: Recon, Wireless, Web)
   - History (Tactical log archive)

2. Neural Intelligence Engine Integration:
   - Integrate Google Gemini API for "Neural Probes" and "Smart Tooltips".
   - Support for Local LLM endpoints (Ollama/LM Studio) via OpenAI-compatible chat/completions.
   - Implement a "Charges" system (Core Charges and Neural Charges) with reload timers for AI actions.
   - AI must respond with strictly formatted JSON for UI-integrated reports.

3. Visual Design:
   - Colors: #00ffd5 (Teal), #bd00ff (Purple), #ff3e3e (Red), #020406 (Deep BG).
   - Component styles: Transistor-inspired buttons with "leads/pins", HUD rect frames, blurring background haze.
   - Animated Logo: A simplified schematic CPU/Core package with a pulsing status die.

4. Functionality:
   - Guided Wizards for complex tools like Nmap and Deauthentication.
   - Interactive Bash Terminal overlay for direct command injection.
   - Unified tactical log stream with source-specific filtering (Kernel, Neural, Console, System).
   - "Audit Dots": Integrated small dots next to AI probe buttons that, when clicked, open a dialog to inspect the raw JSON packet analyzed by the engine.
   - Real-time Connection Monitoring: Interface must visually respond to node health status, switching to a disconnected state (Red Core) if the heartbeat fetch fails or times out.

5. Developer Specs:
   - React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts.
   - Robust error handling for AI endpoints (400/500 errors).
   - Mocked simulation mode for offline testing.
